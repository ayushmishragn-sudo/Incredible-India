        <h2>History of Hawa Mahal</h2>
        <p>Hawa Mahal, located in Jaipur, Rajasthan, was built in 1799 by Maharaja Sawai Pratap Singh. It was designed by Lal Chand Ustad in the form of a crown to resemble Lord Krishna's crown. The palace was constructed to allow royal women to observe everyday life and festivals on the street below without being seen, in accordance with the purdah system.</p>
        <p>The Hawa Mahal stands as a symbol of Jaipur's rich cultural heritage and serves as an important landmark in the Pink City.</p>
