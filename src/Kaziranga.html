        <h2>History of Kaziranga National Park</h2>
        <p>Kaziranga National Park, located in Assam, was established in 1905 as a protected area for the Indian one-horned rhinoceros. Declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1985, it spans over 430 square kilometers of grasslands, wetlands, and forests.</p>
        <p>The park owes its conservation success to dedicated efforts by British officials, Indian conservationists, and the local Karbi and Mising tribes.</p>
